// Abstraction
// In the context of programming, these kinds of vocabularies are usually
// called abstractions. Abstractions give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher (or more abstract) level, without getting sidetracked
// by uninteresting details.

// Higher-order functions
// Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.
// function greaterThan(n) {
// return m => m > n;
// }
// let greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10);
// console.log(greaterThan10(11));
