# 📚 Learning Roadmap 2025 🚀

Welcome!  
This repository documents my **daily journey of learning JavaScript and full-stack development** in 2025.  
I’m using **Eloquent JavaScript**, **HTML5 Boilerplate**, and unique personal projects to build both foundational skills and real-world applications.  

---

## 📅 Repository Structure
Each **week** has its own folder. Inside it:
- `dayX.md` → notes, code snippets, and reflections for each day.
- `projects/` → projects built that week.

Example:
week1/
├── day1.md
├── day2.md
└── projects/
├── bible-assistant/
└── chess-game/

There’s also a `resources/` folder with useful references and links.

## 🎯 Goals
- ✅ Build consistent coding habits (daily commits).  
- ✅ Work through *Eloquent JavaScript* deeply (chapter by chapter).  
- ✅ Learn best practices from [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).  
- ✅ Create unique projects that solve real problems or explore fun ideas.  
- ✅ Share progress transparently to inspire others.

## 🌟 Highlight Projects
- **Bible Assistant (API-based)** → personal project connecting faith + tech.  
- **2D Chess** → inspired by *Eloquent JavaScript* exercises.  
- **Cool Web Tools** → e.g., task trackers, unique utilities, and creative experiments.  
- More will be added as I grow!
